# Phase 3 Implementation Summary

**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Focus**: Military Production & Advanced Defense

---

## Implemented Features

### 1. Garrison - Automated Military Production ‚úÖ

**File**: `server/js/Entity.js` (lines 893-1009)

**Features Implemented:**
- **Automated soldier production every 5 minutes** (18000 frames = 5 minutes)
- **House requirement**: Garrisons only produce units if owner has a House
- **Grain-based production**: 
  - Minimum 20 grain to produce any unit
  - Max garrison size = (total grain / 50)
  - Prevents overpopulation
- **Unit types with resource costs**:
  - **Footsoldier**: 20 grain, 10 wood
  - **Skirmisher**: 20 grain, 15 wood, 5 iron
  - **Cavalier**: 30 grain, 20 wood, 10 iron (requires nearby Stable)
- **Smart prioritization**: Produces best unit based on available resources
- **Stable integration**: Cavalry only produced if Stable exists within 20 tiles

**Code Structure:**
```javascript
Garrison.update(){
  - productionTimer (check every 18000 frames = 5 min)
  - Verify owner has House
  - Check grain availability (min 20)
  - Count current military units
  - Calculate max garrison size (grain / 50)
  - Check for nearby stable (cavalry requirement)
  - Determine best unit type to produce
  - Deduct resources and spawn unit
}
```

**Console Output:**
- `‚öîÔ∏è Garrison produced Footsoldier for [House]`
- `‚öîÔ∏è Garrison produced Skirmisher for [House]`
- `‚öîÔ∏è Garrison produced Cavalier for [House]`

**Benefits:**
- Automated military growth based on economy
- Prevents resource drain (production stops if low grain)
- Multiple garrisons = faster army growth
- Encourages grain economy + iron forging

### 2. Stable - Horse Regeneration System ‚úÖ

**File**: `server/js/Entity.js` (lines 882-925)

**Features Implemented:**
- **Passive horse regeneration**: 1 horse per hour (216000 frames)
- **Max capacity**: 5 horses per stable
- **Grain-based upkeep**: Costs 10 grain to regenerate each horse
- **Unlocks cavalry**: Garrison checks for stable before producing Cavalier units
- **Player mount rental** (backend ready, UI pending)

**Code Structure:**
```javascript
Stable.update(){
  - horseRegenTimer (check every 216000 frames = 1 hour)
  - Check if at max capacity (5 horses)
  - Check owner's grain stores
  - If grain >= 10, deduct grain and add horse
}
```

**Console Output:**
- `üê¥ Stable regenerated a horse (3/5)`

**Benefits:**
- Enables cavalry production at garrisons
- Long-term grain economy sink
- Prevents instant cavalry spam

### 3. Stronghold - Advanced Defense + Unit Storage ‚úÖ

**File**: `server/js/Entity.js` (lines 1108-1218)

**Features Implemented:**

#### **A) Long-Range Arrow Defense**
- Fires arrows every 1.5 seconds (90 frames)
- **12-tile range** (768px) - longer than guardtower
- **15 damage per arrow** - stronger than guardtower (10 dmg)
- **Faster arrow speed** (12 vs 10)
- Unlimited ammo
- Only attacks on overworld (z=0)

#### **B) Unit Garrison System**
- **`garrisonUnit(unitId)`**: Stores allied military units inside stronghold
  - Must be within 2 tiles (128px)
  - Checks alliance with `allyCheck()`
  - Stores unit data (id, class, hp, hpMax)
  - Removes unit from active play (z=-999)
  - Protected from combat while garrisoned
  
- **`releaseUnit(index)`**: Releases stored units
  - Spawns at stronghold entrance
  - Restores to z=0 (overworld)
  - Maintains HP state

**Code Structure:**
```javascript
Stronghold.update(){
  - attackTimer (fire every 90 frames = 1.5 sec)
  - Scan for enemies within 768px
  - Find nearest enemy
  - Create Arrow with 15 damage, faster speed
}

Stronghold.garrisonUnit(unitId){
  - Verify unit exists and is military
  - Check distance (< 128px)
  - Check alliance
  - Store unit data
  - Set unit.z = -999 (stored state)
  - Log garrison
}

Stronghold.releaseUnit(index){
  - Verify unit still exists
  - Calculate spawn position
  - Set unit.z = 0 (active)
  - Remove from garrisonedUnits array
  - Log release
}
```

**Console Output:**
- `üè∞ Stronghold fires at [Enemy] (768px)`
- `üè∞ Footsoldier garrisoned in stronghold`
- `üè∞ Footsoldier released from stronghold`

**Benefits:**
- **Strongest defensive building** (range, damage, rate)
- **Unit protection**: Store military units safely during attacks
- **Strategic storage**: Hide army strength from enemies
- **Fast response**: Release units when needed

## Integration & Dependencies

**All features use existing systems:**
- `Building.update()` - automatic timer management
- `allyCheck()` - alliance validation
- `House.list[]` - faction resource pools
- `Player.list[]` - unit tracking
- `Arrow` entity - projectile system
- Military unit constructors: `Footsoldier()`, `Skirmisher()`, `Cavalier()`

**Code compiles successfully** ‚úÖ

## Game Economy Flow

**Resource Chain:**
```
Serfs gather resources ‚Üí Daily deposits to buildings
                        ‚Üì
Buildings store in dailyStores ‚Üí Transfer to House stores
                        ‚Üì
House stores feed: Forge (iron conversion)
                   Garrison (unit production)
                   Stable (horse regen)
                        ‚Üì
Military production ‚Üí Defense & expansion
```

**Military Production Requirements:**
- **House**: Must exist to produce units
- **Grain**: Primary resource for all units (20-30 per unit)
- **Wood**: Secondary resource (10-20 per unit)

- **Stable**: Required for Cavalier units

**Defense Tiers:**
1. **Outpost**: Detection only (no damage)
2. **Guardtower**: 8-tile range, 10 dmg, 2 sec cooldown
3. **Stronghold**: 12-tile range, 15 dmg, 1.5 sec cooldown + unit storage

- [ ] Check console for "‚öîÔ∏è Garrison produced [Unit]" messages
- [ ] Verify max garrison size scales with grain (1 unit per 50 grain)

**Stable:**
- [ ] Build stable with 10+ grain
- [ ] Wait 1 hour, verify horse regenerates
- [ ] Check console for "üê¥ Stable regenerated a horse" messages
- [ ] Verify cavalry can't be produced without stable

**Stronghold:**
- [ ] Build stronghold, approach with enemy
- [ ] Verify arrows fire every 1.5 sec at 12-tile range
- [ ] Check console for "üè∞ Stronghold fires at [Enemy]" messages
- [ ] Test `garrisonUnit()` with military unit
