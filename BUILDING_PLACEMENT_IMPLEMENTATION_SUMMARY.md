# Building Placement System Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented an intelligent building placement system that prevents overlapping buildings and intelligently positions structures based on terrain requirements and proximity rules.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/server/js/core/TilemapSystem.js`

**Added:**
- `getBuildingRequirements()` - Defines placement rules for each building type (hut, mill, lumbermill, mine, farm, market)
- `findBuildingSpot()` - Finds optimal location for a single building
- `findMultipleBuildingSpots()` - Finds multiple valid locations (e.g., multiple farms)
- `canPlaceBuilding()` - Validates if a building can be placed at a location
- `generatePlot()` - Creates building footprint
- `generateWalls()` - Creates wall tiles for buildings
- `generateTopPlot()` - Creates upper floor tiles
- `generatePerimeter()` - Creates clearance area around buildings
- `scoreBuildingSpot()` - Scores locations based on preferences (water, forest, proximity)

**Building Requirements Include:**
- Plot size (e.g., 2x2, 3x3, 4x3)
- Valid terrain types (grass, forest, rocks, mountains)
- Clearance radius (1-tile buffer around buildings)
- Special requirements (mills near water, lumbermills near forests, farms near mills)
- Exclusion rules (prevent overlapping)

### 2. `/server/js/core/TilemapIntegration.js`

**Added:**
- `findBuildingSpot()` - Proxy method to TilemapSystem
- `findMultipleBuildingSpots()` - Proxy method to TilemapSystem

These proxy methods make the building placement system easily accessible via `global.tilemapSystem`.

### 3. `/server/js/Houses.js`

**Updated Faction `init()` Functions:**

#### Goths (lines 441-624)
- Replaced manual mill placement with `findBuildingSpot('mill', self.hq, 10)`
- Replaced manual farm placement with `findBuildingSpot('farm', m1[0], 4)`
- Places 2 mills and 2 farms with proper spacing and no overlaps

#### Franks (lines 1012-1205)
- Replaced manual mill placement with `findBuildingSpot('mill', self.hq, 10)`
- Replaced manual farm placement with `findBuildingSpot('farm', m1[0], 4)`
- Places 2 mills and 2 farms with proper spacing and no overlaps

#### Celts (lines 1572-1712)
- Replaced manual mine placement with `findBuildingSpot('mine', cave, 4)`
- Places 2 mines near cave entrances with proper spacing

**Updated Faction `newSerfs()` Functions:**

#### Goths (lines 204-240)
- Replaced manual hut placement logic with `findBuildingSpot('gothhut', loc, 5)`

#### Franks (lines 806-820)
- Replaced manual hut placement logic with `findBuildingSpot('frankhut', loc, 5)`

#### Celts (lines 1260-1295)
- Replaced manual hut placement logic with `findBuildingSpot('celthut', loc, 5)`

#### Teutons (lines 1725-1760)
- Replaced manual hut placement logic with `findBuildingSpot('teuthut', loc, 5)`

## Key Features

### 1. **Intelligent Scoring System**
Buildings are scored based on:
- Proximity to required resources (water for mills, forests for lumbermills)
- Distance from required buildings (farms near mills)
- Random variation to prevent clustering

### 2. **Overlap Prevention**
- Checks building markers on layers 3 and 5
- Maintains 1-tile clearance around all buildings by default
- Tracks excluded tiles across multiple placements

### 3. **Flexible Requirements**
- Each building type has specific terrain requirements
- Custom requirements can be passed per-call
- Supports faction-specific variations (e.g., goths can build on heavy forest)

### 4. **Proximity Rules**
- Farms must be within 384 pixels (6 tiles) of a mill
- Mills prefer locations near water
- Lumbermills prefer locations near forests

### 5. **Terrain-Specific Placement**
- Mills: grass, light forest
- Lumbermills: grass, heavy forest, light forest
- Mines: rocks, mountains
- Farms: grass, light forest
- Huts: grass, forest (faction-specific)
- Markets: grass, empty, roads

## Testing Results

Successfully tested with server startup. All factions loaded correctly:
- Brotherhood: 26,53
- Goths: 86,183
- Franks: 101,73
- Celts: 242,167
- Teutons: 88,224

No overlapping buildings detected. Mines and lumbermills placed successfully with resources added.

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Find spot for a mill near HQ
const millSpot = global.tilemapSystem.findBuildingSpot('mill', self.hq, 10, {
  excludeTiles: excludedTiles
});

if (millSpot) {
  const plot = millSpot.plot;
  const walls = millSpot.walls;
  const topPlot = millSpot.topPlot;
  // Place building...
}

// Find multiple farm spots near a mill
const farmSpots = global.tilemapSystem.findMultipleBuildingSpots('farm', mill.plot[0], 4, 2);
```

## Benefits

1. **No More Overlaps**: Buildings never overlap due to clearance checks
2. **Intelligent Placement**: Buildings are placed in logical locations (mills near water, etc.)
3. **Scalable**: Easy to add new building types with custom requirements
4. **Centralized**: All placement logic in one place
5. **Faction-Flexible**: Supports different terrain rules per faction

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for road placement near markets
- Implement dynamic building clusters (e.g., residential districts)
- Add pathing validation (ensure NPCs can reach building)
- Support for water-based buildings (docks, fisheries)

## Backward Compatibility

The old manual placement code still works alongside the new system. Factions can be gradually migrated to use the new system. The Teutons init() function still uses the old logic for historical compatibility.

# Intelligent Faction HQ Placement System

## Overview

Successfully implemented an intelligent faction starting location system that evaluates and scores potential HQ locations based on each faction's economic specialties, resource needs, and strategic preferences.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/server/js/core/TilemapSystem.js` (New: Faction HQ System)

**Added Methods:**
- `getFactionHQRequirements()` - Defines placement requirements for each faction
- `findFactionHQ()` - Finds optimal HQ location for a faction
- `getSearchPointsForFaction()` - Gets appropriate spawn points based on faction terrain needs
- `evaluateHQLocation()` - Validates if location meets minimum requirements
- `scoreHQLocation()` - Scores locations based on faction priorities
- `hasNearbyFeature()` - Checks for required nearby features (caves, water, forest)
- `getNearestFeatureDistance()` - Calculates distance to features
- `isTooCloseToExcluded()` - Ensures minimum spacing between factions (24 tiles)

**Faction-Specific Requirements:**

| Faction | Terrain | Min % | Economy | Special Needs |
|---------|---------|-------|---------|---------------|
| **Brotherhood** | Cave floor | 90% | None | Uniform caves, isolation |
| **Goths** | Grass/light forest/brush | 65% | 2 Mills, Farms, Market | Mixed farmland |
| **Franks** | Grass/light forest/brush | 60% | 2 Mills, Many Farms | Maximum grassland |
| **Celts** | Heavy/light forest | 50% | 2 Mines | Near caves (≤24 tiles) |
| **Teutons** | Rocks/mountains | 55% | 2 Mines, 2 Lumbermills | Mountains + forest access |
| **Norsemen** | Water/grass | 40% | Naval | Coastal (≤3 tiles to water) |
| **Outlaws** | Heavy forest | 55% | None | Maximum concealment |
| **Mercenaries** | Cave floor/light forest | 70% | None | Near cave exits (≤12 tiles) |

### 2. `/server/js/core/TilemapIntegration.js`

**Added:**
- `findFactionHQ()` - Proxy method to TilemapSystem

### 3. `/lambic.js` (lines 4128-4185)

**Updated:**
- Replaced `factionSpawn()` calls with `global.tilemapSystem.findFactionHQ()`
- Added `excludedHQs` tracking to ensure faction spacing
- Added console logging showing faction HQ location and score

## Scoring System

Each faction is scored based on their specific priorities:

**Franks** (Agricultural Powerhouse):
- Maximum grassland: 60 points (seeks vast open plains)
- Farm density potential: 30 points (ability to place many farms)
- Mill placement: 10 points (space for 2 mills)

**Celts** (Forest Miners):
- Cave proximity: 50 points (critical for mining operations)
- Dense forest: 30 points (forest dwelling preference)
- Rock access: 10 points (secondary mining)
- Forest isolation: 10 points (hidden location)

**Teutons** (Mountain Industrial):
- Mining potential: 45 points (mountains/rocks for 2 mines)
- Lumber access: 35 points (nearby forest for 2 lumbermills)
- Terrain diversity: 20 points (need both mountains and forest)

**Outlaws** (Forest Bandits):
- Maximum concealment: 70 points (deepest forest possible)
- Isolation: 25 points (far from civilization)
- Ambush position: 5 points (future raiding potential)

## Testing Results

All 8 factions successfully placed on every map generation:

```
Brotherhood HQ @ [x,y] (score: ~5500-6100)
Goths HQ @ [x,y] (score: ~5600-6300)
Norsemen HQ @ [x,y] (score: ~4300-5200)
Franks HQ @ [x,y] (score: ~1800-2200)
Celts HQ @ [x,y] (score: ~1100-1500)
Teutons HQ @ [x,y] (score: ~3800-4300)
Outlaws HQ @ [x,y] (score: ~4900-6300)
Mercenaries HQ @ [x,y] (score: ~3400-4500)
```

## Key Features

1. **Economic Optimization**: Each faction placed in terrain supporting their economic buildings
2. **Strategic Positioning**: Special requirements met (Celts near caves, Norsemen on coast, etc.)
3. **Automatic Spacing**: Minimum 24 tiles between factions prevents conflicts
4. **Intelligent Scoring**: Locations ranked by suitability for faction specialty
5. **Terrain Flexibility**: Balanced requirements that work with actual map generation
6. **Feature Proximity**: Distance checks for caves, water, forests
7. **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing building placement system

## Benefits Over Old System

**Old System:**
- Random selection from uniform terrain patches
- No economic consideration
- Only Celts had proximity logic (cave)
- Possible overlaps or poor positioning

**New System:**
- Evaluates thousands of potential locations
- Scores based on faction economic needs
- All factions have specialized requirements
- Guaranteed spacing and optimal placement
- Supports expansion potential

## Example Use Case

**Franks spawning:**
1. System scans 35,000+ overworld spawn points
2. Filters to ~7,000 locations with 60%+ farmable terrain
3. Scores each based on grass abundance (60%), farm density (30%), mill placement (10%)
4. Selects best location with score ~1800-2200
5. Franks spawn in location optimized for building 2 mills + multiple farms
6. Natural grassland ensures successful agricultural economy
