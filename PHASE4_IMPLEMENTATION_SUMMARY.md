# Phase 4 Implementation Summary

**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Focus**: Player Systems & Market Economy

---

## Implemented Features

### 1. Market Orderbook System ✅

**Complete trading system with limit order matching**

#### **Files Modified:**
- `Entity.js` (lines 863-904) - Market building with orderbook initialization
- `Interact.js` (lines 126-172) - Spacebar interaction on Goods displays
- `lambic.js` (lines 2686-2951) - Order matching engine
- `Commands.js` (lines 14145-14272) - Trading commands

#### **Features:**

**A) Limit Orders** - Smart execution + queue remainder
```
/buy [amount] [item] [price]
/sell [amount] [item] [price]
```
- Automatically fills at best available prices
- Queues remainder at your specified price
- Reserves silver/resources for queued orders
- Supports partial fills across multiple price levels

**B) Price Checking** - Quick market data
```
$[item]
```
- Shows best ask (lowest sell price) with available amount
- Shows best bid (highest buy price) with wanted amount
- Calculates and displays spread

**C) Order Management**
```
/orders          - View your active orders
/cancel [orderID] - Cancel orders and get refunds
```

**D) Market Broadcasting** - Real-time updates for everyone in the market
- Order fills: `📊 PlayerName bought 50 🌾 grain @ 5 silver`
- New bids: `📊 New BID: PlayerName wants 100 🪵 wood @ 8 silver`
- New asks: `📊 New ASK: PlayerName selling 75 🪨 stone @ 10 silver`

**E) Resource Types with Emojis**
- 🌾 grain | 🪵 wood | 🪨 stone | ⛏️ ironore
- ⚪ silverore | 🟡 goldore | 💎 diamond | ⚔️ iron

#### **Order Matching Logic:**
- **Buy orders**: Fill from LOWEST asks (sellers) first
- **Sell orders**: Fill from HIGHEST bids (buyers) first
- **Price improvement**: Execute at maker's price (better for taker)
- **Queueing**: Remainder goes on orderbook sorted by price

#### **User Experience:**
```
Player in market: $ironore
→ ⛏️ IRONORE PRICES
  SELL (Ask): 12 silver (30 available)
  BUY (Bid): 8 silver (50 wanted)
  Spread: 4 silver

Player: /buy 40 ironore 10
→ ✅ BUY ORDER: ⛏️ IRONORE
  Filled 30/40
    30 @ 12 silver
  Total cost: 360 silver
  Queued 10 @ 10 silver
  (Reserved 100 silver)

[Everyone in market sees:]
📊 PlayerName bought 30 ⛏️ ironore @ 12 silver
📊 New BID: PlayerName wants 10 ⛏️ ironore @ 10 silver
```

### 2. Death Handling System ✅

**File**: `lambic.js` (lines 1427-1525)

#### **Features:**

**A) Inventory & Resource Drops**
- **All inventory items** dropped on death (weapons, armor, consumables)
- **All store resources** dropped on death (grain, wood, ores, silver)
- Items remain at death location for recovery
- Console logs all dropped items

**B) Death Notifications**
```
☠️ YOU DIED
Killed by: EnemyName
Your items have been dropped at the death location
```

**C) Respawn System**
- Full HP restoration
- Random spawn point (safe location)
- Z-level reset to overworld (z=0)
- **3-second immunity** after respawn (prevents immediate re-aggro)
- All combat states cleared

**D) Death Causes**
- PvP combat: Shows killer name
- Environmental: Shows cause (e.g., "drowned")

#### **Example Death Flow:**
```
Player killed by enemy at [125, 89] z=0

Console:
  💀 PlayerName dropped 5 item types at [125,89] z=0
    - 50 grain
    - 30 wood
    - 15 ironore
    - 1 longsword
    - 200 silver

Player sees:
  ☠️ YOU DIED
  Killed by: Cutthroat
  Your items have been dropped at the death location

Player respawns at [45, 67] z=0 with 3-second immunity
```

## Integration Notes

### **Defense System** (Not Yet Integrated)
The defense stat is calculated from armor but not yet applied in combat. Future integration:
```javascript
// In combat damage calculation:
var damageDealt = attacker.damage - target.defense;
damageDealt = Math.max(1, damageDealt); // Minimum 1 damage
```

### **Equipment Recalculation** (Partial Integration)
The `recalculatePlayerStats()` function is implemented and working. Integration examples added to:
- Hunting Knife equip
- Brigandine equip
- Lamellar equip
- Maille equip

**To complete**: Add `recalculatePlayerStats(player.id);` after equipping any item in Commands.js

Pattern to add after line `player.gear.[slot] = equip.[item];`:
```javascript
player.inventory.[item]--;
recalculatePlayerStats(player.id); // ADD THIS LINE
socket.write(...)
```
