# Faction AI System - Final Implementation Summary

## System Overview

A complete goal-oriented AI system for NPC factions that enables autonomous development, strategic decision-making, and faction-specific behaviors. Factions make daily decisions about resource gathering, building construction, military training, and territorial expansion.

## Core Components Implemented

### 1. MapAnalyzer (Unified Location Analysis)
**File:** `server/js/ai/MapAnalyzer.js`

**Handles all location analysis needs:**
- Initial HQ placement for all 8 factions
- Faction-specific terrain requirements
- Cave entrance detection (via global.caveEntrances)
- Underground chamber detection (open space requirements)
- Outpost site selection (future expansion)
- Building site evaluation

**Key features:**
- Faction-specific requirements with adaptive thresholds
- Layer support (overworld z:0, underworld z:-1)
- Proper faction spacing (24 tiles surface, 15 tiles underground)
- Diagnostic logging for tuning
- Fallback systems for edge cases

### 2. Goal System with Dependencies
**Files:** `server/js/ai/Goals.js`, `ResourcePlanner.js`, `GoalChain.js`

**Goal Types Implemented:**
- **Economic:** BuildMill, BuildFarm, BuildMine, BuildLumbermill, BuildGarrison, GatherResource
- **Military:** TrainMilitary, DeployScout, DefendTerritory
- **Expansion:** EstablishOutpost
- **Warfare:** AttackEnemy

**Key features:**
- Resource cost tracking
- Building prerequisites (e.g., farm requires mill)
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Goal chaining (need garrison → gather wood → build garrison → train units)
- Execution with actual building construction

### 3. Building Constructor
**File:** `server/js/ai/BuildingConstructor.js`

**Actually constructs buildings:**
- Uses TilemapSystem.findBuildingSpot() for validation
- Updates terrain tiles correctly
- Blocks pathfinding appropriately
- Creates Building entities with proper parameters
- Integrates with existing game systems

**Buildings supported:**
- Mills, Farms, Mines, Lumbermills, Garrisons

### 4. Faction-Specific Strategies
**Files:** `server/js/ai/strategies/`

**8 Custom Strategy Modules:**
- **GothsStrategy** - Defensive farmers
- **FranksStrategy** - Farming experts (5 farms per mill)
- **CeltsStrategy** - Mining-focused, never builds lumbermills
- **TeutonsStrategy** - Aggressive military-first
- **NorsemenStrategy** - No building (temporary raiders)
- **BrotherhoodStrategy** - No building (underground)
- **OutlawsStrategy** - No building (not finalized)
- **MercenariesStrategy** - No building (underground)

**Each strategy evaluates goals differently based on:**
- Faction profiles (economic priorities, building preferences)
- Utility modifiers (same goal, different priorities)
- Custom logic (Celts scout for caves, Teutons prioritize garrison)

### 5. Territory Management
**File:** `server/js/ai/TerritoryManager.js`

**Dynamic territory calculation:**
- Tracks core base vs outposts
- Calculates center of mass of buildings
- Territory radius = 2x average building distance
- Finds optimal building spots within territory
- Detects when territory is full (triggers expansion)
- Supports future wall placement around perimeter

### 6. Faction Knowledge & Scouting
**Files:** `server/js/ai/FactionKnowledge.js`, `ScoutBehavior.js`

**Intelligence system (fog of war for AI):**
- Tracks explored tiles
- Stores known resource locations
- Records enemy sightings
- Initial territory scan gives immediate knowledge
- Scout framework ready for future deployment

### 7. Main AI Controller
**File:** `server/js/ai/FactionAI.js`

**Coordinates all systems:**
- Loads faction-specific profile and strategy
- Evaluates goals daily using strategy module
- Creates goal chains with dependency resolution
- Executes goals progressively
- Updates territory knowledge
- Provides status reporting

## Game Integration

### Daily Evaluation Loop
**Files Modified:** `server/js/core/GameState.js`, `server/js/Houses.js`

- **GameState.updateTime()**: Triggers `House.evaluateAI()` on new day
- **House.evaluateAI()**: Calls each faction's AI controller
- **Faction AI**: Evaluates and executes top-priority goal

### Faction Initialization
**File:** `server/js/Houses.js`

All 8 factions initialize with:
- AI controller (non-enumerable to prevent JSON circular refs)
- Starting resources (100 wood, 60 stone, 50 grain) for builders
- Faction-specific strategy loaded by name
- Initial territory scan for resource discovery

### Safety Features

**1. Circular Reference Protection:**
- `house.ai` made non-enumerable
- `house.buildingConstructor` made non-enumerable
- Houses can be safely JSON.stringify'd for clients

**2. Cave Entrance Protection:**
- Helper function `findSafeFirepitLocation()` detects cave entrances
- Places firepit on adjacent tile if HQ is a cave
- Prevents blocking critical access points

**3. Method Safety Checks:**
- Building tally functions check if `newSerfs()` exists
- Prevents crashes for factions without serf spawning (Norsemen)

**4. Underground Chamber Detection:**
- Brotherhood: 35% open space requirement, 8-tile radius
- Mercenaries: 40% open space requirement, 6-tile radius
- Ensures spawning in open chambers, not tight tunnels

## Faction Placement Requirements

## Faction Behavior Patterns

### Building Factions (4 active)

**Goths AI Strategy:**
- Day 1: Build farm (utility 40 × 1.2 = 48)
- Day 2: Build mine (utility 40 × 1.1 = 44)
- Day 3: Build more farms
- Goal: Balanced farming + defense, stone mining

**Franks AI Strategy:**
- Day 1: Build mill (utility 55 × 1.3 = 71.5)
- Day 2: Build farm (utility 50 × 1.5 = 75)
- Day 3-6: Build 4 more farms (5 farms per mill!)
- Goal: Maximum grain production

**Celts AI Strategy:**
- Day 1: Build mine near cave (utility 60 × 1.5 = 90!)
- Day 2: Build second mine
- Day 3: Build mill (utility 40)
- Never builds lumbermills (utility × 0)
- Goal: Ore mining dominance, guerrilla tactics

**Teutons AI Strategy:**
- Day 1: Build garrison (utility 60 × 1.3 = 78)
- Day 2: Train military (utility 50 × 1.4 = 70, requires garrison)
- Day 3: Build mine or lumbermill
- Goal: Military superiority, resource control

### Non-Building Factions (4 passive)

**Norsemen:**
- Mechanic: Spawn → raid inland → attack enemies → return → despawn
- AI returns empty goal arrays (raiding not yet implemented)

**Brotherhood:**
- Underground monks (z:-1)
- AI returns empty goal arrays
- Future: Underground-specific goals

**Outlaws:**
- Forest bandits
- AI returns empty goal arrays (strategy not finalized)
- Future: Ambushing, mobile camps

**Mercenaries:**
- Underground fighters (z:-1)
- AI returns empty goal arrays
- Future: Mercenary contracts, recruitment

## Technical Details

### Resource Planning
- Calculates production rates per building type
- Estimates time needed to gather resources
- Creates subgoals for missing resources
- Prevents attempting goals without sufficient resources

### Goal Chaining Example
```
Goal: Train Military Units
└─ Blocked by: Need garrison
   └─ Blocked by: Need 50 wood, 30 stone (have: 20 wood, 10 stone)
      
Result Chain:
1. GatherResource(wood, 30) - Wait for accumulation
2. GatherResource(stone, 20) - Wait for accumulation
3. BuildGarrison - Execute when resources available
4. TrainMilitary - Execute when garrison exists
```

### Territory Dynamics
```javascript
// Example: Goths with 5 buildings
coreBase: {
  center: [85, 85], // Average position
  radius: 18, // 2× average distance
  buildings: 5
}

// When territory is full (density > 0.05):
outpost = territory.findOutpostLocation()
// Returns tile 20-40 tiles from core base
```

### Cave Entrance Protection
```javascript
// If HQ is on cave entrance (terrain 6):
firepitLoc = grid[0] // Use adjacent walkable tile
// Instead of:
firepitLoc = self.hq // Would block the cave!
```

## What Works Right Now

### On Server Start
1. MapAnalyzer scans map for optimal faction HQ locations
2. Each faction places at best available location matching requirements
3. **Celts spawn AT cave entrances** (0 tiles away)
4. Underground factions spawn in open chambers (not tunnels)
5. All AI controllers initialize with faction strategies
6. Initial territory scans give knowledge of nearby resources

### On Day 1 (First In-Game Day)
1. Server logs: "=== Day 1 ==="
2. `House.evaluateAI()` called for all factions
3. Each building faction evaluates possible goals:
   ```
   Goths AI: Evaluating (Day 1)
   Goths: Selecting goal BUILD_FARM (utility: 48.0)
   Goths: Executing BUILD_FARM
   Goths: Built farm at [[87,85]]
   ```
4. Non-building factions evaluate but return empty arrays

### On Day 2+
- Factions continue executing goal chains
- Resources accumulate from existing buildings
- New buildings are constructed when affordable
- Different factions develop differently:
  - Celts build ore mines
  - Franks spam farms
  - Teutons build garrison then military
  - Goths balance farming and defense

## Known Working Features ✓

Based on test output:
- ✓ All 8 factions initialize successfully
- ✓ Cave entrance detection working

2. ✓ Goths - Buildable area (10%+ grass/brush)
3. ✓ Norsemen - Coastal area (10%+ water/grass)
4. ✓ Franks - Buildable area (8%+ grass/brush)
5. ✓ Celts - Cave entrance with forest
6. ✓ Teutons - Diverse terrain
7. ✓ Outlaws - Forest area
