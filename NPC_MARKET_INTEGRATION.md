# NPC Market Integration - Complete Guide

**Status**: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED  
**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Focus**: NPC Serf Market Selling Behavior

## How NPC Serfs Use the Market

### **Resource Retention System**

When serfs gather resources, they keep some for themselves:

**Male Serfs (SerfM):**
- **Grain**: Collect 10 → Deposit 6 → Keep 3-4 + get flour
- **Wood**: Collect 10 → Deposit 8 → Keep 2
- **Stone**: Collect 10 → Deposit 8 → Keep 2
- **Iron Ore**: Collect 1 → Deposit immediately (keep minerals for themselves)
- **Silver/Gold/Diamond**: Keep all (rare finds!)

**Female Serfs (SerfF):**
- **Grain**: Collect 10 → Deposit 6 → Keep 3-4 + get flour + bread
- Females can bake bread from flour

---

## Market Selling Behavior

### **When Serfs Go to Market**

**Time**: After work ends (VI.p - clockout time)

**Requirements:**
1. Serf must have a tavern assigned
2. Tavern must have an associated market (`tavern.market`)
3. Serf must have sellable resources

**Decision Logic** (Lines 5523-5553, 6428-6458):
```javascript
if(Building.list[self.tavern].market){
  if(inv.flour > 0 || inv.wood > 0 || inv.stone > 0 || inv.ironore > 0){
    self.action = 'market';
    console.log(self.name + ' heads to the market');
  }
}
```

### **Market Selling Prices**

NPCs sell at fixed base prices:

| Resource | NPC Sell Price | Type |
|----------|----------------|------|
| Flour/Grain | 3 silver | Common |
| Bread | 5 silver | Common |
| Wood | 8 silver | Common |
| Stone | 10 silver | Common |
| Iron Ore | 15 silver | Uncommon |
| Silver Ore | 40 silver | Rare |
| Gold Ore | 80 silver | Very Rare |
| Diamond | 200 silver | Ultra Rare |

---

### **Selling Process**

**Step 1: Travel to Market** (Lines 5654-5663, 6559-6603)
- Serf paths to market building
- Enters first floor (z=1)
- Finds random spot to stand in market

**Step 2: Sell Resources** (Lines 5665-5708, 6605-6623)
- Checks inventory for each resource type (priority order)
- Calls `global.processSellOrder(self.id, resource, quantity, price)`
- Sells ONE resource type per visit (flour > wood > stone > ore)

**Step 3: Order Matching**
- **If buy orders exist at or above NPC price**: Instant fill!
- **If no buyers**: Creates sell order on orderbook
- Resources are reserved until order fills

**Step 4: After Selling**
- Waits in market for a period
- Then transitions to tavern or home

## Example NPC Market Flow

### **Scenario: Farmer Serf with Extra Grain**

```
VI.a - Work day begins
→ Serf gathers grain all day

VI.p - Work day ends
→ Serf has 10 grain in inventory
→ Deposits 6 grain to mill owner
→ Keeps 3 grain + 1 flour
→ action = 'clockout'

[Clockout handler checks:]
→ Tavern has market? YES
→ Has flour? YES
→ action = 'market'
→ Console: "Serf heads to the market"

[Market action handler:]
→ Serf paths to market building
→ Enters first floor (z=1)
→ Checks inventory: flour = 1
→ Calls processSellOrder(self.id, 'grain', 1, 3)

[Order matching:]
→ Orderbook has BID: 100 grain @ 5 silver
→ Instant fill! Serf sells 1 flour @ 5 silver
→ Serf gets 5 silver
→ Buyer gets 1 grain
→ Console: "Serf sold resources at market"

[After selling:]
→ Waits in market for random period
→ Then: action = 'tavern'
→ Heads to tavern for socializing
→ Later: action = 'home'
→ Heads home for the night
```

## Broadcast Filtering

**NPCs DO NOT broadcast to market** (prevents spam):
- ❌ No "NPC bought/sold" messages
- ❌ No "New BID/ASK from NPC" messages
- ✅ Orders still appear in orderbook
- ✅ Players can still see NPC orders when viewing orderbook

**Players DO broadcast:**
- ✅ "PlayerName bought 50 🌾 grain"
- ✅ "New BID: PlayerName wants 100 🪵 wood"
- ✅ Live market activity visible

**Implementation** (Lines 3044-3047, 3088-3091, 3175-3178):
```javascript
if(player.type === 'player'){
  broadcastToMarket(market.id, message);
}
```

## Resource Flow Example

### **Full Daily Cycle:**

```
Morning (VI.a):
→ Serf starts work at lumbermill

During Day:
→ Chops 10 wood
→ Deposits 8 wood to lumbermill owner
→ Keeps 2 wood in inventory

Evening (VI.p):
→ Clocks out
→ Checks: Tavern has market? YES
→ Checks: Has wood? YES (2 wood)
→ Heads to market

At Market:
→ Sells 2 wood @ 8 silver
→ Orderbook has buyer @ 10 silver? FILLS INSTANTLY
→ Serf gets 20 silver (2 × 10)
→ Console: "Serf sold resources at market"

Night (XI.p):
→ Leaves market
→ Heads home with 20 silver earned
```

## Integration Points

**Existing Systems Used:**
1. **Tavern-Market Linkage**: Taverns find nearby markets on initialization
2. **Clockout Behavior**: Already checks for market and resources
3. **Market Pathfinding**: Already paths to market building
4. **Orderbook System**: NPCs use same trading engine as players

**Code Modified:**
1. **Entity.js** (Lines 5669-5708, 6609-6623):
   - Implemented actual selling in `action == 'market'` handler
   - Added all resource types with appropriate prices
   - Console logging for sales
   
2. **lambic.js** (Lines 3044-3047, 3088-3091, 3175-3178):
   - Added NPC detection to broadcast filtering
   - Prevents NPC spam in market
   - Players still see NPC orders in orderbook

## Market Liquidity

**NPCs provide natural market liquidity:**
- Constant supply of common resources (grain, wood, stone)
- Occasional supply of rare resources (ores)
- Fixed pricing creates price floor
- Players can undercut NPC prices for faster sales
- Players can buy from NPCs at fixed prices

**Example Orderbook with NPCs:**
```
📊 Market Orderbook

🌾 GRAIN
  SELL: 3 @ 3 silver (NPC serf)
  SELL: 50 @ 4 silver (Player)
  BUY: 100 @ 5 silver (Player)

🪵 WOOD  
  SELL: 2 @ 8 silver (NPC serf)
  SELL: 2 @ 8 silver (NPC serf)
  SELL: 100 @ 9 silver (Player)
  BUY: 50 @ 7 silver (Player)
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Build tavern + market near a mill/lumbermill
- [ ] Wait for work day to end (VI.p)
- [ ] Check console: "Serf heads to the market"
- [ ] Check console: "Serf sold resources at market"
- [ ] View market orderbook: See NPC sell orders
- [ ] Buy from NPC: Verify transaction completes
- [ ] Check: NPCs don't spam market broadcasts
