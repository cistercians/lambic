# Phase 1 Implementation Summary

**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Date**: October 17, 2025

---

## Implemented Features

### 1. Outpost Sentry Alert System ✅

**File**: `server/js/Entity.js` (lines 440-519)

**Features Implemented:**
- Scans for enemies every 2 seconds within 12 tiles (768px)
- Sends orange alert message to building owner: "⚠️ ALERT: [Enemy] detected near your outpost at [X,Y]"
- Prevents spam by tracking alerted enemies for 30 seconds
- **Auto-Response**: Nearby allied guards (within 20 tiles) automatically respond to threats
- Guards switch to 'defend' action and path to threat location
- Only detects on overworld (z=0)

**Code Structure:**
```javascript
Outpost.update(){
  - scanTimer (check every 120 frames)
  - Clean up old alerts (30 sec expiry)
  - Scan for enemies
  - Send socket message to owner
  - Command nearby military units to respond
}
```

**Testing Notes:**
- Outpost.update() is automatically called by Building.update() (line 865)
- Guards must have `military` property = true to respond
- Alliance checked via existing allyCheck()

---

### 2. Monastery Passive Healing Aura ✅

**File**: `server/js/Entity.js` (lines 747-779)

**Features Implemented:**
- Heals allied units/players inside monastery by 1 HP every 3 seconds
- Only works inside building (z=1)
- Free (no resource cost)
- Silent (no chat spam)
- Checks alliance via allyCheck()
- Caps healing at entity.hpMax

**Code Structure:**
```javascript
Monastery.update(){
  - healTimer (check every 180 frames = 3 seconds)
  - Loop through Player.list
  - Check if entity is at z=1 inside THIS monastery
  - Check if allied
  - Heal 1 HP if below max
}
```

**Testing Notes:**
- Heals both players and NPCs
- Works for building owner's faction/house
- Uses existing getBuilding() to verify location

---

### 3. Innkeeper Leashing System ✅

**File**: `server/js/Entity.js` (lines 6276-6317)

**Features Implemented:**
- Innkeepers check distance from tavern (home) every 5 seconds
- Leash range: 10 tiles (640px)
- If too far, innkeeper returns to tavern entrance
- Prevents combat interrupting return
- Clears action when back within safe range (5 tiles)

**Code Structure:**
```javascript
Innkeeper.update(){
  - leashCheckTimer (check every 300 frames = 5 seconds)
  - Calculate distance from home
  - If > 10 tiles: set action='returning', path to home
  - If returning and < 5 tiles: clear action, resume normal
  - Call super_update() for normal Character behavior
}
```

**Testing Notes:**
- Only enforced on overworld (z=0)
- Won't interrupt combat
- Uses existing moveTo() for pathfinding

---

## Integration Points

All three features integrate seamlessly with existing systems:

1. **Building.update()** (line 861) automatically calls update() on all buildings
2. **allyCheck()** used for alliance validation
3. **SOCKET_LIST** used for player alerts
4. **getBuilding()** used to verify entity location
5. **Character.update()** parent method preserved via super_update pattern

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Build an outpost, verify enemy detection alerts appear in chat
- [ ] Verify guards respond to outpost alerts automatically
- [ ] Enter monastery, verify gradual healing (check HP increasing every 3 sec)
- [ ] Verify monastery only heals allies, not enemies
- [ ] Observe innkeeper wandering, verify they return to tavern when too far
- [ ] Verify innkeeper stays near tavern entrance after returning

## Next Steps (User Approval Required)

**Phase 2**: Resource Automation
- Forge iron conversion (passive)
- Guardtower defense (unlimited arrows to start)
- Tavern healing (passive)

**Should I proceed with Phase 2, or would you like to test Phase 1 first?**
