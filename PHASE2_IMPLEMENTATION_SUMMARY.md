- Arrow entity for guardtower projectiles
- SOCKET_LIST for player alerts

**Code compiles successfully** ‚úÖ

## Testing Checklist

**Forge:**
- [ ] Mine iron ore, build forge, verify conversion to iron bars every 30 sec
- [ ] Build multiple forges, verify faster conversion rate
- [ ] Check console for "Forge converted 1 Iron Ore ‚Üí 1 Iron Bar" messages

**Guardtower:**
- [ ] Build guardtower, approach with enemy, verify arrows fire every 2 sec
- [ ] Check console for "üèπ Guardtower fires at [Enemy]" messages
- [ ] Verify arrows deal 10 damage
- [ ] Verify 8-tile range (512px)

**Tavern:**
- [ ] Enter tavern with damaged HP, verify healing 1 HP / 2 sec

## Next Steps

**Phase 3**: Military Production (per original plan)
- Garrison automated soldier production (grain-dependent)
- Stable mount system (passive: cavalry unlock, active: player mounts)
- Stronghold defense + garrison storage

**Note**: Garrison requires:
- House system to be created first
- Silver currency for some features
- Military unit production logic

**Should I proceed with Phase 3, or would you like to test Phases 1 & 2 first?**
