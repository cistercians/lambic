# Event Communication System - Implementation Complete

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

### Core Event System
- **EventManager.js**: Complete centralized event system with batched logging, ring buffer history, and multiple communication modes
- **Event Categories**: Economic, Building, Combat, Environment, Social, Death, Stealth, Faction, Item, AI
- **Communication Modes**: None, Player, House, Area, Global, Spectator
- **Performance Optimized**: Batched logging (100ms intervals), ring buffer (1000 events), lightweight objects

### Event Integration Points
- **Combat Events**: Added to SimpleCombat.js for attacks, damage tracking
- **Death Events**: Added to lambic.js die() function with killer tracking
- **Building Events**: Added to Build.js for building completions
- **Economic Events**: Added to lambic.js for wood chopping (proof of concept)
- **Environment Events**: Added to lambic.js for day/night transitions
- **Item Events**: Added to BaseItem.js for pickup/drop tracking
- **Combat Escape**: Added to lambic.js for escape tracking

### Spectator Camera Intelligence
- **SpectatorDirector.js**: Intelligent camera director that uses events to select targets
- **Priority System**: Death > Combat > Building > Economic > Environment
- **Smart Switching**: Locks to targets until conclusion events, smooth transitions
- **Event Tracking**: Monitors combat participants, building activity, economic milestones
- **Client Integration**: Integrated with existing spectator camera system

### Server Integration
- **Global EventManager**: Initialized in lambic.js and available globally
- **Spectator Broadcasting**: Events sent to spectators with structured data
- **Test Command**: `/testevents` command to verify system functionality

### Client Integration
- **SpectatorDirector**: Loaded in index.html and initialized for spectators
- **Event Processing**: Handles spectatorEvent messages for camera control
- **Camera Commands**: Dispatches custom events for camera target switching

## 🎯 Key Features

### Event History & Analytics
- Ring buffer with 1000 recent events (~60 seconds at high activity)
- Query methods: by category, subject, position, time range
- Event statistics: combat hotspots, economic activity, death counts
- Automatic cleanup of old events

### Intelligent Spectator Camera
- Tracks combat participants by damage/attack frequency
- Follows highest-activity combatant until death/escape
- Switches to building/economic priorities when no combat
- Smooth 2-second transitions between targets
- Minimum 5-second lock duration per target

### Performance Optimizations
- Batched console logging (100ms intervals)
- Fixed memory usage with ring buffer
- Minimal event object size
- No deep cloning in hot paths
- Event subscriptions for AI systems

## 🧪 Testing

Use the `/testevents` command in-game to:
- Create test combat and economic events
- Verify event system is working
- View event statistics
- Test spectator broadcasting

## 🚀 Future Enhancements Ready

The system is designed to be easily extensible:
- **AI Subscriptions**: AI factions can subscribe to relevant events
- **Event Chains**: Link related events for better storytelling
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time event visualization
- **More Event Types**: Easy to add new categories and events
- **Migration Path**: Existing console.log/chat messages can be gradually replaced
